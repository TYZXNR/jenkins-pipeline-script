This is a Jenkins pipeline script written in Groovy, a programming language used for scripting in Jenkins. 

The pipeline consists of several stages that define the steps to be executed in the pipeline.

Let us go through the pipeline step by step:

The agent any line specifies that the pipeline can run on any available agent (slave node) in the Jenkins environment.

The options block is used to define additional pipeline options. In this case, the timestamps option is enabled, which adds timestamps to the console output for each step.

The tools block is used to define the tools that the pipeline needs. The maven tool with version 'Maven-3.8.4' is configured in this case. This ensures that the correct version of Maven is available for the pipeline.

The stages block defines the different stages of the pipeline. Each stage represents a logical step in the build process.

a. The first stage is named "Git Checkout." Within this stage, the pipeline performs a git checkout operation to fetch the source code from a GitHub repository. 

The credentialsId parameter specifies the ID of the Jenkins credential containing the necessary credentials for accessing the repository, and the url parameter specifies the URL of the repository.

b. The second stage is named "Maven Clean Build". Within this stage, the pipeline executes a shell command (sh) to run Maven with the clean install goals. The -f option is used to specify the location of the Maven project file (pom.xml).

c. The third stage is named "SonarQube Analysis". Within this stage, the pipeline sets up the environment for SonarQube analysis using the withSonarQubeEnv block. The SonarQube scanner is executed with the clean install goals and the additional sonar:sonar goal to perform the analysis. The SonarQube environment is configured with the name 'josh'.

d. The next stages involve building and working with Docker images. The "Build Docker Image" stage checks the Docker version (docker version) and then builds a Docker image with the tag 'king-httpd' (docker build -t king-httpd .).

e. The "Docker Image list" stage lists the Docker images available on the system (docker image list).

f. The "Docker Image Tag" stage tags the previously built image as 'josh1991/king-httpd:king-httpd' (docker tag king-httpd josh1991/king-httpd:king-httpd).

g. The "Docker Login to Hub Docker" stage performs a Docker login operation using the Docker Hub credentials stored in the Jenkins credential with ID 'DOCKER_HUB_PASSWORD'. The credentials are retrieved and passed to the docker login command.

h. The "Docker Image Push" stage pushes the Docker image 'josh1991/king-httpd:king-httpd' to the Docker Hub repository (docker push josh1991/king-httpd:king-httpd).

That's a high-level overview of the steps performed in this Jenkins pipeline. Each stage represents a specific task or operation that needs to be executed in the build process, and the pipeline ensures that these steps are executed in the specified order.
